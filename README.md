# CommonGround

Find what to watch, listen to, and enjoy together! CommonGround helps couples and friends discover shared entertainment by analyzing their individual preferences.

## The Problem

Ever spent 30+ minutes scrolling through Netflix with someone, never agreeing on what to watch? CommonGround solves this by finding the overlap in your entertainment preferences.

## How It Works

1. **Person 1** enters their favorite movies, actors, directors, genres, YouTubers, streamers, and musicians
2. **Person 2** does the same
3. CommonGround analyzes both profiles and recommends content you'll **both** enjoy
4. Each recommendation comes with an explanation of why it matches both of your tastes

## Features

- **Smart Matching**: Goes beyond simple overlaps to find content that matches both people's preferences
- **Multi-Platform**: Movies, TV, YouTube, Twitch, and music recommendations
- **Explanation Engine**: Tells you exactly why each recommendation works for both of you
- **No Account Required**: Just enter preferences and get results

## Running Locally
